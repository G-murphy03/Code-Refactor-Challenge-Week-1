# Code-Refactor-Challenge-Week-1
First Sydney University coding bootcamp challenge, consisting of refactoring code to follow accessibility standards for a company named Horiseon Social Solution Services written in HTML/CSS.

We were given a code which used a significant amount of non-semantic elements namely div elements and were expected to ensure that the appearance of the website stayed consistent but utilise semantic elements to follow accessibility standards so that the site is optimised for search engines. 

This meant there was a acceptance criteria when:
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

Further, I also improved the codebase by consolidating the CSS as there were many duplicates which completed the same styling. 

This is the result:

*Note that this layout is designed for desktop viewing, so elemenets don't stay consistent at smaller resoultions. We have not yet learnt how to make elements responsive so that web application is optimised for any screen size.
